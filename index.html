    <p>Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo first met in 1987 at their Parisian secondary school, Lyc√©e Carnot. They created a indie rock style band called Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in the year of 1992. However, they were inspired to switch genres after witnessing electronic dance music at raves and nightclubs. 
The duo called themselves Daft Punk after a British music critic called a  song from their band, Darlin' "daft punky thrash".</p>
